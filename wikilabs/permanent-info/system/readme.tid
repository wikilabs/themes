title: $:/themes/wikilabs/permanent-info/readme

This theme provides a tiddler info button, with a persistent open/close status. The status is saved in "state-variables". 

The "save" configuration tiddlers have been changed. So the new state variables are permanently saved.

*[[$:/config/SyncFilter]]
*[[$:/config/SaverFilter]]

''Important:'' Those filters need a reload, to take effect :/
